            <p class="">
                <strong>Jomplay was a simple app idea, to book futsal courts seamlessly.</strong> 
                What started off as a side project for over two years, gained momentum 
                with the help of two dear friends. The three of us now
                run the app as a service and are expanding it to more sports and
                courts in the ASEAN region. The problems we were trying to solve initially:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Booking a court still requires calling or messaging the court staff (subject to human error & poor service).</li> 
                <li>Organizing a game is tedious with WhatsApp groups and endless back and forth messages.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="text-medium-grey serif">Visual identity</h3>
            <p>
                We envisioned the product as bold and sporty, yet simple. To inspire people to play
                sports more frequently by making booking and organizing games easy.
                The identity is a combination of clean bold geometry, edgy street colors, and sports courts.
                Each of which, reflect the personalities of our target users and the functionality of the product.

            <h4 class="font-weight-medium">Make booking simple and painless</h4>
            <p>
                One of the biggest issues with booking courts via phone call or messaging is dealing with the person
                on the other line. More often than not, court staff are rude, uninviting, and re-shuffle bookings
                to maximize returns. All of which are confusing and unliked by users. 
                <br> <br>
                To resolve this, I use a combination of both location and action words throughout the main app flow 
                to orient and direct the user. This creates friendly actionable messaging and ensures that users have a clear 
                path to booking a court.
                <br> <br>
                A common practice among regular players is re-booking their previous game for next week.
                By providing a simple quick action on the home screen, regular bookers can shorten their
                usual booking flow down to a single tap.

            <h4 class="font-weight-medium">Teams and open games for fast invites</h4>
            <p>
                - issue with organiation and player commitment/canclellation how we solve that
                - easy to leave join, find new players
                After making booking users can invite friends to app. Regular players typically
                play with same people. Therefore make sense to create groups. That can be invited with a
                single tap instead of tap on multiple users one by one.

            <h3 class="text-medium-grey serif">Final thoughts and deliverables</h3>
            <p>
                Being my first ever app as a self-taught designer, I'd reflect on not having done any proper initial
                framework for user testing, which would have been a huge help in making decisions. Fortunately, I'm still
                in a position to work on this, and will definitely provide updates from time-to-time on its progress. Stay tuned!
