                    Jomplay was a simple app idea, to book futsal courts seamlessly. 
                    What started off as a side project, gained momentum 
                    with the help of two friends. The three of us now
                    run the app as a service and are expanding it to more sports and
                    courts.

                                The idea started from a group of futsal players that were
                                upset about how their court bookings were consistently being 
                                mis-managed. We realized that there was an opportunity to provide
                                a service that would make booking sports courts pain-free. <br><br>   In addition
                                to bookings, we wanted to provide features that helped users organize their
                                games, pay cashless and find new players easily. Here are three of
                                the key problems we looked to tackle in our initial MVP release.

                                        as it combined the perfect amount of rounded-ness while still
                                        providing clean sharp edges throughout multiple weights. 
                                        Both roundness and sharp edges we're a key component in representing 
                                        sports and courts. And as a bonus, the ultra-italic weight was absolutely perfect
                                        for use in our social media, to capture our users attention.</p>

                                        A punchy green proved itself to be the primary color for our interface main CTA's.
                                        While grey's were used liberally to impart the feeling of edgy street sports – a common
                                        theme among our target audience with a sporty lifestyle.

                                    <p>To avoid confusing users with many icons (abstract symbols),
                                        I made it a guiding principle to use words wherever possible.
                                        Especially in areas with key actions. As such, icons are used 
                                        sparingly in this app. For the few that there are, I simply ensured
                                        that their construction was aligned with our typography – bold, edgy and geometric.

                                    <p>The wordmark started off with just the word 
                                        "jomplay". After getting some user
                                        input we found that it didn't convey the 
                                        emotions we wanted. Our identity felt more like we'd built a task manager over a
                                        sports app. I then began to explore the notion of the court itself
                                        as the primary marker for our identity – we are a sports court 
                                        booking app after all.
                                    </p> <br>
                                    <p> What finally emerged were the very court
                                        lines that basically convey the entire existence of the court.
                                        Boundaries built by humans for contained explosions of fun and skill.
                                        And so, the notion of pushing yourself till the edge of the court infused
                                        itself into our mark, bringing the elements of motion and dynamicity that
                                        were missing from before.

                                This was a really exciting, fun and personal project for me.
                                Having been the first working product I designed, it holds a special place in my heart.
                                <br><br>
                                As the current Chief Design Officer for Jomplay, I'm always excited to take it
                                further. And although I can't always provides updates for it here, the next steps
                                for it are so much clearer, having literally built it from the ground up. 
                                Here are some of my important takeaways from this project:
                            </p><br>

                                    <p>
                                        Getting the product early to market, would have
                                        reaped its own rewards by allowing us to conduct more research
                                        and testing with real users. Even if that meant not having certain
                                        features.

                                       I learned that figuring out why, and writing it down, 
                                       is probably the best thing you can do for yourself when
                                       making design decisions. Keep tabs on why you made one choice
                                       over another.

                        <p class="text-max-width">
                        I started with the visual identity, to help create a framework for aligning the
                        apps interface with the objectives of the brand. After conducting a few brand and identity
                        discussions with the team, we had a clearer picture of what feelings we hoped to impart through the experience.
                        We envisioned the product as bold and sporty, yet simple. To inspire people to play sports more frequently 
                        by making booking and organizing games easy.
                    </p> 
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="big serif">
                        The identity is a combination of clean bold geometry, edgy street colors, and sports courts.
                        Each of which, reflect the personalities of our target users and the functionality of the product.

                    <p class="font-weight-medium">Improving the user experience</p>

                <h4 class="font-weight-medium">Make booking simple and painless</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest issues with booking courts via phone call or messaging is dealing with the person
                    on the other line. More often than not, court staff are rude, uninviting, and re-shuffle bookings
                    to maximize returns. All of which are confusing and unliked by users. 
                    <br> <br>
                    To resolve this, I use a combination of both location and action words throughout the main app flow 
                    to orient and direct the user. This creates friendly actionable messaging and ensures that users have a clear 
                    path to booking a court.
                    <br> <br>
                    A common practice among regular players is re-booking their previous game for next week.
                    By providing a simple quick action on the home screen, regular bookers can shorten their
                    usual booking flow down to a single tap.

                <h4 class="font-weight-medium">Teams and open games for fast invites</h4>
                <p>
                    - issue with organiation and player commitment/canclellation how we solve that
                    - easy to leave join, find new players
                    After making booking users can invite friends to app. Regular players typically
                    play with same people. Therefore make sense to create groups. That can be invited with a
                    single tap instead of tap on multiple users one by one.

                <h3 class="text-medium-grey serif">Final thoughts and deliverables</h3>
                <p>
                    Being my first ever app as a self-taught designer, I'd reflect on not having done any proper initial
                    framework for user testing, which would have been a huge help in making decisions. Fortunately, I'm still
                    in a position to work on this, and will definitely provide updates from time-to-time on its progress. Stay tuned!
